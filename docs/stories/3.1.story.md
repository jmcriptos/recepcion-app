## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Story 2.3 Dev Agent Record]
- Basic registration CRUD endpoints already implemented in `apps/api/src/app/routes/registrations.py`
- Role-based access control working with @operator_or_supervisor_required and role filtering
- Spanish error message framework established in auth middleware
- Comprehensive validation for weight (5-50kg), cut_type (jamón/chuleta), and supplier fields
- Data filtering operational: operators see only their own data, supervisors see all data

### API Specification Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#api-specification]

**Enhanced Registration Endpoints:**
- PUT /api/v1/registrations/{id} - Update existing registration (registrant or supervisor only)
- DELETE /api/v1/registrations/{id} - Soft delete registration (@supervisor_only)
- GET /api/v1/registrations/stats - Aggregate statistics with role-based filtering
- GET /api/v1/registrations/search - Advanced search with multiple criteria
- PATCH /api/v1/registrations/{id}/photo - Update registration photo

**Request/Response Format Enhancement:**
```json
{
  "registration": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "weight": 15.5,
    "cut_type": "jamón",
    "supplier": "Proveedor Cárnico SA",
    "photo_url": "https://s3.../photo.jpg",
    "ocr_confidence": 0.95,
    "registered_by": "user_id",
    "created_at": "2025-08-20T10:30:00Z",

    "update_reason": "weight_correction"
  }
}
```

**Statistics Response Format:**
```json
{
  "stats": {
    "total_registrations": 150,
    "total_weight": 2250.5,
    "average_weight": 15.0,
    "by_cut_type": {
      "jamón": {"count": 90, "total_weight": 1350.0},
      "chuleta": {"count": 60, "total_weight": 900.5}
    },

      "from": "2025-08-01",
      "to": "2025-08-20"
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Models Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#data-models]

**WeightRegistration Model Enhancement:**
- Add `updated_at` timestamp field for tracking modifications
- Add `deleted_at` timestamp for soft delete functionality
- Add `updated_by` foreign key for tracking update authors
- Add `update_reason` enum field for audit trail
- Enhance photo metadata with file size and OCR confidence tracking

**Audit Log Model:**
```python
class RegistrationAuditLog(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.String(36), primary_key=True)
    registration_id = db.Column(db.String(36), nullable=False)
    action = db.Column(db.Enum('CREATE', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE'), nullable=False)
    user_id = db.Column(db.String(36), nullable=False)
    changes = db.Column(db.JSON)  # Store field changes
    timestamp = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
```

- Pagination tested with edge cases (empty results, large datasets)
- Error scenarios tested (404, 403, validation errors)

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture.md#security-requirements]

**Access Control Enhancement:**
- Update operations restricted to original registrant or supervisors
- Delete operations restricted to supervisors only (@supervisor_only)
- Statistics filtered by role (operators see only their own data)
- Audit logging includes user context and IP addresses
- Rate limiting on search endpoints to prevent abuse

**Data Protection:**
- Soft delete maintains data integrity for audit purposes
- Photo URLs validated to prevent path traversal attacks
- Input sanitization for all search parameters
- Structured logging excludes sensitive data

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture.md#performance-requirements]

**Database Optimization:**
- Add indexes on frequently searched fields (supplier, cut_type, created_at)
- Implement cursor-based pagination for efficient large dataset handling
- Use database aggregation functions for statistics calculations
- Cache statistics results for frequently accessed data

**API Response Optimization:**
- Implement response compression for large datasets
- Add ETag support for conditional requests
- Optimize JSON serialization for mobile data usage
- Add request timeout handling for slow queries

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#error-handling-strategy]

**Enhanced Spanish Error Messages:**
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "REGISTRATION_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "No se encontró el registro con el ID especificado",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-20T10:30:00Z",
    "requestId": "uuid-request-id",
    "details": {
      "registration_id": "invalid-uuid",
      "user_id": "current-user-id"
    }
  }
}
```

**Error Codes for New Endpoints:**
- `REGISTRATION_NOT_UPDATABLE` - Registration cannot be modified
- `INSUFFICIENT_DELETE_PERMISSIONS` - User cannot delete registration  
- `INVALID_SEARCH_CRITERIA` - Search parameters are invalid
- `PHOTO_UPDATE_FAILED` - Photo replacement operation failed
- `STATISTICS_CALCULATION_ERROR` - Error computing aggregate statistics
