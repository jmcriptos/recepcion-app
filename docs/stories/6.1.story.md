### Data Models
[Source: architecture.md#data-models]

**Local SQLite Schema (mirrors backend):**
```sql
-- Users table (local cache)
CREATE TABLE users (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('operator', 'supervisor')),
    active INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_login TEXT
);

-- Weight registrations table (offline-capable)
CREATE TABLE weight_registrations (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    weight REAL NOT NULL CHECK (weight > 0 AND weight <= 50),
    cut_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (cut_type IN ('jamón', 'chuleta')),
    supplier TEXT NOT NULL,
    photo_url TEXT,
    local_photo_path TEXT, -- Additional field for local storage
    ocr_confidence REAL CHECK (ocr_confidence >= 0 AND ocr_confidence <= 1),
    sync_status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' 
        CHECK (sync_status IN ('synced', 'pending', 'failed')),
    registered_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (registered_by) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Sync queue for operation management
CREATE TABLE sync_queue (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    operation_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (operation_type IN ('create_registration', 'upload_photo', 'update_user')),
    entity_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    payload TEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON payload
    priority INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    retry_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    last_attempt_at TEXT,
    error_message TEXT,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### Technical Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]

**Offline-First Architecture:**
- **State Management**: Zustand stores with persistence via AsyncStorage
- **Local Database**: SQLite via react-native-sqlite-storage
- **Photo Storage**: Local filesystem via react-native-fs
- **Network Detection**: @react-native-community/netinfo
- **Sync Strategy**: Background queue processing with retry logic

### API Integration Points
[Source: architecture.md#api-specification]

**Sync Endpoints (already implemented):**
- `POST /api/v1/registrations` - Create registration (for sync)
- `POST /api/v1/ocr/process-image` - Upload and process photos
- `GET /api/v1/registrations/today` - Validate local data against server
- `GET /api/v1/auth/current-user` - Validate user session

**Sync Strategy:**
- **Priority 1**: User registrations (critical business data)
- **Priority 2**: Photo uploads (documentation)
- **Priority 3**: User updates (profile changes)

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#performance-optimization]

**Local Storage Targets:**
- SQLite operations: <100ms for CRUD operations
- Image compression: <2s for photos, target <2MB final size
- Sync queue processing: 5 operations/second maximum
- Local data retention: 30 days of registrations

**Memory Management:**
- Maximum 50MB local database size
- Photo cleanup after successful upload (keep last 7 days)
- Queue cleanup for completed operations (keep errors for 24h)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]

**Dependencies Required:**
- react-native-sqlite-storage: ^6.x - SQLite interface
- react-native-fs: ^2.x - File system operations

- Secure photo storage with proper file permissions
- Queue data validation to prevent injection attacks
- Session token encryption in local storage

### Project Structure Notes
✅ **Full Alignment**: All required components fit into established architecture patterns. The offline functionality extends existing services without requiring structural changes.

**Key Implementation Areas:**
1. New service layer for offline operations extending existing API services
2. Enhanced state management with offline-aware stores
3. Background sync coordination integrated with current authentication flow
4. UI components for offline status that integrate with existing industrial design patterns
