### Repository Structure Configuration
[Source: architecture.md#high-level-architecture]
- **Structure:** Monorepo with clear mobile/backend separation  
- **Monorepo Tool:** npm workspaces (lightweight, sufficient for 2-app structure)  
- **Package Organization:** apps/ (mobile, api), packages/ (shared types, utilities)

### Environment Configuration Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#environment-configuration]
Required environment variables for Flask backend:
```bash
SECRET_KEY=<flask-secret-key>
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/meat_reception_dev
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://<api-key>:<api-secret>@<cloud-name>
GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=<optional-google-vision-key>
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
TESTING=false
```

### Flask Application Factory Pattern
[Source: architecture.md#service-architecture]
Flask app should follow app factory pattern with environment-based configuration supporting development, testing, and production environments.

### Heroku Deployment Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#deployment-architecture]
- **Platform:** Heroku with Heroku Postgres and Redis add-ons
- **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt && flask db upgrade`
- **Deployment Method:** Git-based deployment with automatic builds
- Requires `Procfile` and `runtime.txt` for Heroku configuration

### Testing
[Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]

**Test Organization:**
- Unit tests in `apps/api/tests/unit/` for models, services, and utilities
- Integration tests in `apps/api/tests/integration/` for API endpoints and database operations  
- Test fixtures in `apps/api/tests/fixtures/` for test data

**Testing Frameworks:**
- pytest 7.x as primary testing framework for Python backend
- Flask-Testing 0.8.x for Flask-specific testing utilities
- Configure pytest.ini with proper test discovery and coverage settings

**Test File Structure:**
```
apps/api/tests/
├── unit/                          # Unit tests
├── integration/                   # Integration tests  
├── fixtures/                      # Test data
└── conftest.py                    # Pytest configuration
```
