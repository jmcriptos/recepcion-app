## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 6.3 completion notes]
- ✅ Complete automatic sync infrastructure implemented with AutomaticSyncService as main coordinator
- ✅ SyncQueueService enhanced with real API integration, conflict resolution, and rollback mechanisms  
- ✅ Existing UI components available: SyncStatusCounter, SyncProgressIndicator, SyncNotificationToast

### Architecture and Technical Context
[Source: docs/architecture.md#frontend-architecture]

**Component Architecture:**
- React Native 0.72.x with TypeScript 5.x for type-safe development
- NativeBase 3.4.x for industrial-optimized UI components with large touch targets
- Component organization: `src/components/` for reusable UI, `src/screens/` for full pages
- Industrial UX requirements: minimum 60px touch targets, high contrast colors, bold text
- Role-based UI adaptation with dynamic interface based on user permissions

**State Management Architecture:**
[Source: docs/architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
- Zustand 4.x for simple mobile state management with offline-first persistence
- AsyncStorage persistence for offline resilience with optimistic UI updates
- Sync status tracking: 'idle' | 'syncing' | 'error' with progress indicators
- Separation of concerns: Auth, data, sync, and UI state clearly separated

**Navigation Architecture:**
[Source: docs/architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- MainTabNavigator with DashboardTab exclusive for supervisors
- Protected route pattern with role-based navigation
- Large tab bar (80px height) for industrial use with bold text
- Dashboard screens under: `apps/mobile/src/screens/dashboard/`

### Data Models and Service Integration

interface WeightRegistration {
  id: string;
  weight: number;
  cut_type: 'jamón' | 'chuleta';
  supplier: string;
  photo_url: string | null;
  ocr_confidence: number | null;
  sync_status: 'synced' | 'pending' | 'failed';
