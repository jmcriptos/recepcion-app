### Data Models
[Source: architecture.md#data-models]

**WeightRegistration Model:**
```python
class WeightRegistration:
    id: UUID
    weight: Decimal(5,2)  # Range: 0-50kg
    cut_type: str  # 'jamón' | 'chuleta'
    supplier: str  # Max 255 chars
    photo_url: str | None  # Cloudinary URL
    ocr_confidence: Decimal(3,2) | None  # 0-1 range
    sync_status: str  # 'synced' | 'pending' | 'failed'
    registered_by: UUID  # Foreign key to users
    created_at: timestamp
    updated_at: timestamp
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture.md#api-specification]

**Existing Endpoints (Already Implemented):**
- `GET /api/v1/registrations` - List with pagination and filters
- `GET /api/v1/registrations/today` - Today's registrations
- `GET /api/v1/registrations/{id}` - Get by ID
- `POST /api/v1/registrations` - Create registration
- `PUT /api/v1/registrations/{id}` - Update registration
- `DELETE /api/v1/registrations/{id}` - Delete (supervisor only)

**Current Query Parameters:**
- `page`: Page number (default: 1)
- `limit`: Items per page (default: 20, max: 100)  
- `supplier`: Filter by supplier name (ILIKE search)
- `cut_type`: Filter by cut type ('jamón' | 'chuleta')
- `date_from`: Start date filter (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `date_to`: End date filter (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Missing Enhancement:**
- `registrations_by_supplier` metadata in response

### File Locations
[Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]

**Backend Files:**
- **Routes**: `apps/api/src/app/routes/registrations.py` (already exists)
- **Models**: `apps/api/src/app/models/registration.py` (already exists)
- **Tests**: `apps/api/tests/integration/test_registration_endpoints.py` (needs enhancement)
- **Unit Tests**: `apps/api/tests/unit/test_registration_*.py` (needs creation)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]

**Backend Testing Structure:**
```
apps/api/tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── test_registration_service.py  # NEW - needs creation
│   └── test_registration_crud.py     # EXISTS - needs enhancement
├── integration/
│   └── test_registration_endpoints.py  # EXISTS - needs enhancement for metadata
└── performance/
    └── test_registration_performance.py  # NEW - for large datasets
```

**Testing Framework:** pytest + Flask-Testing 7.x + 0.8.x

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture.md#backend-architecture]

**Performance Requirements:**
- Pagination max 100 items per request
- Role-based filtering (operators see own data, supervisors see all)
- Database indexes on created_at DESC for performance
- Rate limiting: 60 requests/minute for search endpoints

**Security Requirements:**
- Session-based authentication required for all endpoints
- Role validation (operator/supervisor permissions)
- Input validation for all query parameters
- Structured error responses with request tracking

### Project Structure Notes
✅ **Full Alignment**: All required files exist in expected locations per architecture specification. The registration endpoints are already implemented and functional. This story focuses on enhancement rather than new creation.

**Key Enhancement Areas:**
1. Add missing `registrations_by_supplier` metadata calculation
2. Comprehensive testing coverage for existing functionality  
3. Complete API documentation alignment with implementation
4. Performance optimization for metadata calculations

## Testing

- All filter combinations (supplier, cut_type, date ranges, registered_by)
- Role-based access control (operator vs supervisor data visibility)
- Metadata accuracy (total_count, total_weight, registrations_by_supplier)

### Code Quality Assessment

**EXCEPTIONAL Registration API Enhancement - Production Ready**

This implementation demonstrates outstanding engineering discipline with perfect requirements traceability across all 5 acceptance criteria. The developer correctly identified this as an enhancement story rather than new development and delivered precisely what was missing: the `registrations_by_supplier` metadata. The dual metadata calculation strategy (SQL aggregation for main endpoint, in-memory for today endpoint) shows excellent architectural decision-making optimized for different use cases.

**Code Quality Highlights:**
- **Perfect API Enhancement**: Surgically added missing metadata without disrupting existing functionality
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient SQL GROUP BY aggregation with proper query reuse
- **Security First**: Rate limiting, comprehensive input validation, role-based authorization maintained
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with request IDs and detailed validation messages
- **Monitoring Ready**: Request logging for all search operations with user context
