# Story 2.3: Role-Based Access Control

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** supervisor,  
**I want** access to all registration functions plus supervisor-only features like dashboard and reports,  
**so that** I can both register weights when needed and monitor overall operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Decorador @role_required para proteger endpoints por rol
2. Operators pueden acceder a endpoints de registro y sus propios datos
3. Supervisors pueden acceder a todos los endpoints (registro + dashboard + reportes + gestión usuarios)
4. App móvil muestra funciones adicionales para supervisors (dashboard, reportes, gestión usuarios)
5. Mensajes de error claros para acceso no autorizado

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Stories 2.1 & 2.2 Dev Agent Records]
- Complete authentication API implemented with Flask-Login and @role_required decorator foundation
- Authentication middleware already created in `apps/api/src/app/middleware/auth_middleware.py`
- Mobile authentication complete with user role persistence in Zustand store
- Session management working with 4-hour timeout and Redis storage
- User model includes role field ('operator' | 'supervisor') ready for access control

### Authentication & Authorization Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#authentication-and-authorization]

**Role-Based Access Control Pattern:**
- **Decorator Pattern:** @role_required and @supervisor_only decorators for endpoint protection
- **Permission Model:** Two roles with hierarchical access (supervisor > operator)
- **Session Validation:** Role information stored in Flask-Login session, validated on each request
- **Mobile Role State:** User role persisted in Zustand store for UI conditional rendering

**Access Control Matrix:**
```
Endpoint Group               | Operator | Supervisor
---------------------------|----------|------------
Authentication (/auth/*)   |    ✓     |     ✓
Registration CRUD           |    ✓     |     ✓
Own registrations only      |    ✓     |     -
Dashboard & Analytics       |    ✗     |     ✓
User Management            |    ✗     |     ✓
Reports & Export           |    ✗     |     ✓
```

### Backend Implementation Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#backend-architecture]

**Decorator Implementation Location:**
- Enhance existing: `apps/api/src/app/middleware/auth_middleware.py`
- New decorators: `apps/api/src/app/utils/decorators.py`
- Route protection: Apply to existing routes in `apps/api/src/app/routes/`

**Role Validation Logic:**
```python
def role_required(required_role):
    def decorator(f):
        @wraps(f)
        def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
            if not current_user.is_authenticated:
                return jsonify({'error': 'Authentication required'}), 401
            
            if required_role == 'supervisor' and current_user.role != 'supervisor':
                return jsonify({'error': 'Supervisor access required'}), 403
                
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        return decorated_function
    return decorator
```

**Error Response Format:**
[Source: architecture.md#error-handling-strategy]
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS",
    "message": "No tienes permisos para realizar esta acción",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-20T10:30:00Z",
    "requestId": "uuid-request-id"
  }
}
```

### Mobile Frontend Implementation Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]

**Role-Based Navigation Structure:**
- Enhanced TabNavigator: `apps/mobile/src/navigation/TabNavigator.tsx`
- Conditional dashboard tab rendering based on user.role === 'supervisor'
- Navigation guards for supervisor-only screens

**Supervisor Dashboard Components:**
- Location: `apps/mobile/src/screens/dashboard/`
- DashboardOverviewScreen.tsx - Real-time metrics and statistics
- UserManagementScreen.tsx - Add/edit users (supervisors only)
- ReportsScreen.tsx - Data export and reporting features

**State Management Integration:**
```typescript
// Enhanced auth store with role-based UI helpers
interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  isSupervisor: () => boolean;
  canAccessDashboard: () => boolean;
  canManageUsers: () => boolean;
}
```

**Industrial UI Requirements for Supervisor Features:**
- Large touch targets (60px minimum) for dashboard controls
- High contrast design for metrics visibility
- Bold typography for supervisor alerts and notifications

### API Endpoints Requiring Protection
[Source: architecture.md#api-specification]

**Supervisor-Only Endpoints:**
- GET /api/v1/dashboard - Real-time metrics and analytics
- GET /api/v1/users - List all users
- POST /api/v1/users - Create new user
- PUT /api/v1/users/{id} - Update user information  
- GET /api/v1/reports/export - Export registration data

**Operator + Supervisor Endpoints:**
- All /api/v1/auth/* endpoints (login, logout, current-user)
- POST /api/v1/registrations - Create weight registration
- GET /api/v1/registrations - List registrations (filtered by user for operators)
- GET /api/v1/registrations/today - Today's registrations (filtered for operators)
- POST /api/v1/ocr/process-image - OCR processing

### Data Filtering Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#data-models]

**Operator Data Restrictions:**
- GET /registrations must filter by registered_by = current_user.id for operators
- Dashboard endpoints completely blocked for operators
- User management endpoints blocked for operators
- Export functionality restricted to supervisors only

**Supervisor Access:**
- Full access to all registration data regardless of registered_by
- Administrative access to user management
- Full analytics and reporting capabilities

### Testing Strategy for Role-Based Access
[Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]

**Backend Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests: `apps/api/tests/unit/test_auth_middleware.py`
- Integration tests: `apps/api/tests/integration/test_role_based_access.py`
- Test both successful access and permission denied scenarios
- Mock different user roles in test fixtures

**Frontend Testing Requirements:**
- Component tests: `apps/mobile/__tests__/unit/navigation/TabNavigator.test.tsx`
- Role-based UI tests: `apps/mobile/__tests__/unit/screens/dashboard/`
- Integration tests: `apps/mobile/__tests__/integration/role-based-navigation.test.tsx`
- Test conditional rendering based on user roles

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- All role-protected endpoints tested with both roles
- Mobile UI component rendering tested for both user types
- Error handling scenarios tested (401, 403 responses)
- Session role persistence tested across app restarts

- Create: `apps/mobile/src/screens/dashboard/DashboardOverviewScreen.tsx`
- Create: `apps/mobile/src/screens/dashboard/UserManagementScreen.tsx`
- Enhance: `apps/mobile/src/stores/auth-store.ts`
- Tests: `apps/mobile/__tests__/unit/navigation/`

### Error Handling Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#error-handling-strategy]

**403 Forbidden Response Pattern:**
- Consistent error format across all protected endpoints
- Spanish user-friendly messages for mobile app
- Logging of unauthorized access attempts for security monitoring
- Graceful fallback in mobile app (hide restricted features vs show errors)

**Mobile Error Handling:**
- Display "No tienes permisos para realizar esta acción" for 403 errors
- Redirect to appropriate screen if user tries to access restricted content
- Log permission errors for troubleshooting and security monitoring
