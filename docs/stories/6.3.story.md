### State Management Patterns
[Source: docs/architecture.md#state-management-architecture]

**Zustand Store Integration:**
- Offline-first persistence with AsyncStorage for sync resilience

- Queue management for pending registrations with priority handling

### Performance and UX Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture.md#architectural-patterns]

**Industrial UX Requirements:**
- Sync notifications must be clear and visible with industrial-friendly contrast
- Background sync should not interfere with user workflow
- Battery optimization considerations for industrial devices
- Sync progress visible in dashboard for supervisors

**Performance Targets:**
- Sync initiation: <2s after connectivity detection
- Batch sync processing: <30s for typical daily registrations
- Network efficiency: Minimal data usage during sync operations

**Error Handling Requirements:**
- All sync operations must use standard error handler
- Network failures require exponential backoff retry logic
